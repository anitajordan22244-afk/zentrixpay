# MCP Tool Metrics

The ZentrixPay MCP server can collect **optional, opt-in metrics** about tool
usage: how often each tool is called, how many calls fail, how long they take,
and how many x402 payment attempts succeed or fail. This is useful for operators
who want lightweight visibility into an agent's activity without wiring up a full
observability stack.

Metrics are **off by default** and add zero bookkeeping unless enabled.

## Enabling

Set the `ZENTRIXPAY_METRICS` environment variable to a truthy value
(`1`, `true`, `yes`, or `on`) before starting the server:

```bash
ZENTRIXPAY_METRICS=1 node /path/to/zentrixpay/mcp/dist/index.js
```

When disabled, the `zentrixpay_metrics` tool returns a short note explaining how
to turn it on rather than any counters.

## Reading metrics

Call the `zentrixpay_metrics` tool. Pass `reset: true` to clear the counters
after reading (useful for periodic sampling), and `format` to choose the
export shape:

- `json` (default) — the snapshot object below.
- `otlp` — the same data as an
  [OTLP/JSON `ExportMetricsServiceRequest`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/)
  body (a `resourceMetrics` envelope for an OpenTelemetry collector).

Example output when enabled:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "since": "2026-07-23T18:00:00.000Z",
  "totals": { "calls": 7, "errors": 1 },
  "payments": { "attempts": 2, "failures": 0 },
  "tools": {
    "zentrixpay_browse": { "calls": 3, "errors": 0, "totalDurationMs": 41, "maxDurationMs": 18 },
    "zentrixpay_buy": { "calls": 2, "errors": 1, "totalDurationMs": 220, "maxDurationMs": 140 }
  }
}
```

- `totals` — aggregate call and error counts across all tools.
- `payments` — x402 payment attempts recorded on `zentrixpay_publish`
  (content verification) and `zentrixpay_buy`, with the failing subset.
- `tools` — per-tool call/error counts and durations in milliseconds
  (`totalDurationMs` is the sum, `maxDurationMs` the slowest single call).

The OTLP export represents each counter as an additive `Sum`, each duration as
a `double` `Sum` plus a `max` `Gauge`, and the per-call budget as a `Gauge`;
data points carry `startTimeUnixNano`/`timeUnixNano` and
`aggregationTemporality: CUMULATIVE`.

## Mirroring to stderr

With metrics enabled, set `ZENTRIXPAY_METRICS_EXPORT_CONSOLE=1` to mirror every
tool call's metrics to **stderr** as OTLP/JSON, one line per call:

```bash
ZENTRIXPAY_METRICS=1 ZENTRIXPAY_METRICS_EXPORT_CONSOLE=1 node /path/to/zentrixpay/mcp/dist/index.js
```

Each line is `[zentrixpay-metrics] <otlp-payload>`, sized to the recent budget
window. This keeps stdout clean for MCP framing while letting a wrapper daemon
or log scraper consume the stream.

## Safety

Metrics contain **only tool names, counts, and durations** — never tool
arguments, wallet keys, or API keys. Snapshots are safe to surface to an agent.
When metrics are disabled, no data is collected at all. Failures are still
reported through each tool's normal deterministic `Error: …` response; the
metrics layer only counts them and never alters the message.

The behavior is covered by unit tests in
[`mcp/src/metrics.test.ts`](../mcp/src/metrics.test.ts), including the success
and failure counter paths and the no-secret-leak guarantee.
