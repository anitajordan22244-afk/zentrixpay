# MCP Offline Catalog Cache

`browse`, `search` and `preview` depend on the ZentrixPay catalog API. When that
service is unreachable — DNS failure, refused connection, timeout — they fall
back to the last snapshot captured from a successful read, labelled with its
age. Mutating and payment tools never consult the cache.

The lifetime of those snapshots is configurable
([#573](https://github.com/mind-vault-1/mindvault/issues/573)).

## Configuration

| Variable                             | Default          | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ZENTRIXPAY_CATALOG_CACHE_TTL_MS`     | `86400000` (24h) | Age at which a snapshot starts carrying a staleness warning |
| `ZENTRIXPAY_CATALOG_CACHE_MAX_AGE_MS` | `0` (unlimited)  | Age past which a snapshot is not served at all              |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zentrixpay": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/zentrixpay/mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ZENTRIXPAY_CATALOG_CACHE_TTL_MS": "3600000",
        "ZENTRIXPAY_CATALOG_CACHE_MAX_AGE_MS": "86400000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With nothing set the behaviour is unchanged from before #573: warn after 24
hours, never withhold.

## Two limits, because "stale" and "useless" are different questions

**Past the TTL** a snapshot is still served, with a warning:

```
⚠ Offline catalog snapshot served (cached 2 day ago) — stale; results may be
outdated. Confirm a specific resource on-chain with zentrixpay_registry_lookup
when freshness matters.
```

Offline, a day-old catalog beats no catalog. The agent is told what it is
holding and can decide.

**Past the max age** the snapshot is withheld entirely and the tool fails as if
no cache existed. That is what an operator wants when acting on outdated
pricing is worse than failing — an expired snapshot is dropped rather than
merely hidden, so the memory is released and a later call cannot resurrect it.

`ZENTRIXPAY_CATALOG_CACHE_MAX_AGE_MS=0` disables the second limit, which is the
default.

## Choosing values

- **Fast-moving catalog, agent can retry** — lower the TTL so the warning
  appears sooner: `ZENTRIXPAY_CATALOG_CACHE_TTL_MS=900000` (15 min).
- **Payments driven off catalog prices** — set a max age. A stale price is a
  wrong price, and a warning the model may ignore is not a control.
- **Long offline sessions** — raise the TTL so a genuinely useful snapshot is
  not labelled alarming: `ZENTRIXPAY_CATALOG_CACHE_TTL_MS=604800000` (7 days).

Setting a max age **below** the TTL would make the TTL unreachable — the
snapshot would vanish before it was ever labelled stale. The stricter intent
wins: the TTL is pulled down to match, rather than one setting being silently
ignored.

A malformed or negative value falls back to the default rather than failing
startup. An offline cache is a resilience feature; a typo in its tuning must
not stop the server from serving.

## Scope

The cache is in memory for the lifetime of the server process — the same scope
as profile state. There is deliberately no filesystem use, which keeps "no
cache present" deterministic and independent of anything an earlier run left
behind.

## When the snapshot is served (#837)

The cache answers for one situation: **the catalog could not answer.** That is
narrower than "the call failed", and the difference decides whether the agent
sees a fixable error or stale data.

| Failure                                   | Served from cache | Why                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transport failure (DNS, refused, timeout) | yes               | Nothing answered                                                             |
| 408, 425, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504         | yes               | Transient, and already replayed — see below                                  |
| 400 / 422 (bad filter, malformed request) | **no**            | The catalog answered about _this request_; the agent must fix it             |
| 401 / 403                                 | **no**            | A credentials problem a stale catalog cannot resolve                         |
| 404                                       | **no**            | On `preview`, the id is wrong — another resource's snapshot is not an answer |

Retries come first. `jsonFetch` replays idempotent GETs on those transient
statuses with bounded, jittered backoff (see
[mcp-timeouts-retries.md](mcp-timeouts-retries.md)), so reaching the cache means
the gateway stayed broken for every attempt rather than blinking once.

The label names the real cause, because "unreachable" and "the API answered 503"
point at different things to go fix:

```text
Offline catalog snapshot served (cached 4 min ago) — catalog API unreachable.
Offline catalog snapshot served (cached 4 min ago) — catalog API returned HTTP 503.
```

Serving a snapshot for a client error was the bug behind #837: a `400` on a
malformed filter came back as stale results labelled "catalog API unreachable",
so the agent believed the service was down and kept sending the same invalid
request against data that could never reflect it.

- [`mcp/src/catalogCache.test.ts`](../mcp/src/catalogCache.test.ts) — snapshot
  capture, retrieval and labelling
- [`mcp/src/catalogCacheTtl.test.ts`](../mcp/src/catalogCacheTtl.test.ts) —
  configuration parsing, the TTL/max-age interaction, expiry and eviction
- [`mcp/src/index.test.ts`](../mcp/src/index.test.ts) — which failures serve the
  snapshot and which surface (`offline catalog cache fallback`)
