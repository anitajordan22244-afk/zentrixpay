/**
 * Confirmation guard for the destructive `zentrixpay_reset` tool.
 *
 * Reset deletes wallet secret keys and publisher API keys from memory and disk.
 * An agent that misreads a prompt can trigger it in a single tool call, and the
 * credentials are unrecoverable (the wallet secret is only ever held here). So
 * the tool is two-step: the first call reports exactly what *would* be removed
 * and changes nothing; only a call carrying an explicit `confirm` performs it.
 *
 * This module is pure — it decides and formats, it never touches the filesystem
 * or process state. `index.ts` gathers the live scope and performs the wipe.

 * mode additionally accepts `"on"`, and the argument validator coerces its own
 * set of flag spellings — and reset is the one tool whose false positive is
 * unrecoverable: it deletes wallet secret keys, and with `all` it deletes every
 * profile and the state file.
 *
 * Sharing a widening helper means a change made for a reversible confirmation
 * silently widens this one too, and an agent that meant something else by a
 * newly-truthy value wipes a keystore it believed it was only inspecting. So
 * the vocabulary is pinned here and in `resetGuard.test.ts`: widening reset has
 * to be an explicit edit to this list, reviewed on its own terms.
 *
 * Everything else — a missing argument, an unlisted string, any object — reads
