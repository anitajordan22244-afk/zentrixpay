/**
 * Serialization for state-touching tool calls (#855).
 *
 * The MCP server keeps its profiles, wallet, and publisher API key in
 * module-level state and persists them to `~/.zentrixpay/state.json`. Two tools
 * that both read the active profile and then write it can interleave across an
 * `await`, because nothing in the dispatch path holds a lock:
 *
 *   1. `zentrixpay_buy` reads the active wallet (`requireWallet`), then awaits
 *      the x402 payment.
 *   2. `zentrixpay_reset` clears the profile and persists it.
 *   3. `zentrixpay_buy` resumes and its receipt/response reports state that no
 *      longer exists.
 *
 * The fix is a FIFO async mutex held for the whole of a state-touching tool
 * call. Waiting is strictly ordered so calls cannot starve each other, and a
 * rejected call never wedges the queue — the next caller still runs.
 *
 * Only tools that read-then-write the profile store are serialized. Read-only
 * tools stay fully parallel; holding a lock across a network round trip for a
 * tool that cannot conflict would be a latency cost with no correctness gain.
 */
