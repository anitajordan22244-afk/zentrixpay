/**
 * Integrity checks for wallets the sponsored-account service hands back (#839).
 *
 * `zentrixpay_setup_wallet` posts to an external service, which mints a Stellar
 * account, funds its reserve, adds the USDC trustline, and returns the keypair.
 * The server used to persist whatever came back:
 *
 *     activeProfile().wallet = { publicKey: res.data.publicKey, secretKey: res.data.secretKey };
 *
 * That trusts a remote service to be well-formed on a path where being wrong is
 * expensive. If creation half-completes — the service funds the account and
 * then times out, restarts, or answers from a proxy with a truncated body — the
 * reply can carry an address with no secret, or a secret that belongs to a
 * different account. Persisting it produces the failure mode in the issue: a
 * profile naming a *funded* address that the local keystore cannot sign for.
 *
 * Everything downstream then reads as healthy. `zentrixpay_wallet_info` shows
 * the address and queries Horizon, so it reports a real balance; diagnostics
 * report a wallet present; the agent believes it is ready to pay. The truth only
 * surfaces later, as an opaque signing failure inside an x402 payment.
 *
 * So the keypair is verified at the boundary instead: the address must be
 * derivable *from the secret we hold*. That single check distinguishes "we own
 * this account" from "we know this account's address", which is the whole
 * question. It also covers the stored state, because a profile can reach the
 * same broken shape through a hand-edited state file or a restored backup.
 *
 * The module is pure and takes its key derivation as an argument, so it is
 * unit-testable without the Stellar SDK and cannot itself perform I/O.
