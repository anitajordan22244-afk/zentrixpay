/**
 * Shared response truncation for ZentrixPay MCP tool outputs.
 *
 * Tool handlers build a single text string with no size ceiling, so one long
 * description or a large registry listing can dominate an agent's context window.
 * This module provides a configurable byte budget with safe truncation.
 *
 * ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Use `truncateResponse` only on tool *call results* (the text
 * returned from a handler).  Never apply it to tool *definition descriptions*
 * (the `description` field in `tools.ts`).  Some MCP clients key tools by the
 * exact description string for routing — truncating it changes the advertised
 * contract and silently breaks those clients.  The `assertToolDescriptionSafe`
 * guard below can be called in tests to verify that no tool description is so
 * long it looks like a response that needs truncating.
